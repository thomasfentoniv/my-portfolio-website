  <!-- About Me -->
  <section id="About-Me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am 21 years old and I was born and raised in San Diego County. I am currently living in Menifee, California.I previously went to University of Arizona and majored in computer science; however, I am currently studying business
      at my local community college</p>
    <p>I decided to join Thinkful because I have always been inteerested in technology, and with my background in computer science I
      thought it would be interesting to learn more about the field</p>
    <p>Although I plan to go to university and graduate with a bachelor's degree in business, I would love to be able to incoorperate
      what I have learned in this program in my future endeavors. While studying, I would love to get more experience by working as a 
      part-time web developer. I love collaborating with others and really value learning new concepts and ideas from those around me. I am excited to see where
      this road takes me</p>
    <p>Personally, I love the outdoors and, if I am not working on coding or schoolwork, you would typically find me at the gym, on a hike, 
      or at the beach. Also, I am a big fan of movies. That being said, it doesn't matter what I am doing, as long as I am in good company.</p>
